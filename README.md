- NFT minting  
- Minting your own token

Use this to test ideas and enhance your first Web3 proof of concept on Algorand â€” no coding experience needed.

## ðŸŒŸ How To Get Started Instructions

### **Fork the Repo:**

To create your own copy of this repository:

a. **Go to the GitHub Repository:**
   - Navigate to the main page which is the current one your on.

b. **Click the "Fork" Button:**
   - In the top-right corner of the page, click the **Fork** button. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

c. **Wait for the Forking Process to Complete:**
   - GitHub will take a few moments to create the fork. Once complete, youâ€™ll be redirected to your newly created fork.

## ðŸš€ Start with Codespaces
This is the fastest way to get up and running!

1. **Create a Codespace:**

   - Click the green "Code" button at the top right of your forked repo.
   - Select "Create codespace on main".
   - Once your Codespace is fully loaded, you are ready to go!

**Pro Tip:** GitHub Codespaces is included with free accounts but comes with a monthly limit of 60 hours.  

To avoid losing your progress, be sure to **commit your changes regularly** â€” just like shown in the video demo below â€” so your updates are saved to your forked repository.
